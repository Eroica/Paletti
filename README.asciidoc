= Paletti

I basically took https://alembicforsketch.com/[Alembic] and put it into a JavaFX WebView.
That is all.

Alembic was originally developed by https://www.awkward.co/[Awkward] and licensed under the MIT license.

== Installation

A Windows executable is available on the Releases page.
Paletti is built with `jlink`, and currently still requires an existing JDK installation on your machine.

As soon as `jpackage` is ready, I'll try to make it available standalone.
