= Paletti
:imagesdir: docs/images

Paletti is a small tool to _quantize_ the colors of an image.
This can be used to simplify the image visually or to extract certain key colors.

The quantization process usually extracts colors that are visually close to the original image, but it is not guaranteed to be exact.
It is based on a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_cut[_Modified median cut quantization_] implemented by http://leptonica.org/[Leptonica].

You can increase/decrease the amount of colors by scrolling up/down or using the slider (the size is currently restricted to 3 to 32 colors).
The switch converts the image to grayscale.

Click on a color in the palette to copy its Hex code into the clipboard.
You can also export the simplified version or a screenshot of the color palette.

== Development

Paletti is written in Kotlin using JavaFX.
I also have an old GTK version (written in Vala) and a WIP Android version available in this repository.
However, I mostly work as a 2D/3D artist on Windows these days, so that's why the JavaFX version gets the most development time.

While I probably mostly use Paletti for myself, I develop it publicly in the hope that it is helpful for other people as well.
You are welcome to raise bugs and feature requests here.
