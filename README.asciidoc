= Paletti

I basically took https://alembicforsketch.com/[Alembic] and put it into a JavaFX WebView.
That is all.

Alembic was originally developed by https://www.awkward.co/[Awkward] and licensed under the MIT license.

Click on a tile to put that color into your clipboard.

I added a small feature that you can scroll up and down to increase/decrease the size of the color palette (between 6 and 12).

== Installation

I'm using Launch4j to run Paletti on Windows which requires a prior Java installation.
When building Paletti with Gradle, you can specify the path to the Java environment here:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
launch4j {
    // ...
    bundledJrePath = "C:/path/to/jdk"
}

If you don't want to install Java separately but use IntelliJ (or something similar), you can even reference its `jbr` directory there.

If you don't supply any path, then Launch4j should look for a system-wide Java installation (i.e. by an installer) on startup.
