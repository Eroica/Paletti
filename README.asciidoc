= Paletti

I basically took https://alembicforsketch.com/[Alembic] and put it into a JavaFX WebView.
That is all.

Alembic was originally developed by https://www.awkward.co/[Awkward] and licensed under the MIT license.

Click on a tile to put that color into your clipboard.

I added a small feature that you can scroll up and down to increase/decrease the size of the color palette (between 6 and 12).

== Installation

A Windows executable is available under Releases.
I used `jpackage` to build it which bundles the necessary JRE, so nothing else is required to run Paletti.

For other systems or compiling from source, see <<Building>>.

== Building

Paletti is built with Gradle and packaged with `jpackage` into an executable.

Note that currently (February 2020),

* the badass-runtime-plugin (supplying `jpackage` tasks) is buggy with JDK 13 and JDK 14, so you need to _build_ with an older version,
* `jpackage` is only available from JDK 14, so you need to _package_ with that version.

It's probably the easiest to configure this in the Gradle config:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
runtime {
    javaHome.set("C:/path/to/older/jdk")
    jpackage {
        jpackageHome = "C:/path/to/jdk-14"
        // ...
    }
}

With this setup, you can re-build Paletti from source, and/or create binaries for other systems.
