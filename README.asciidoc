Paletti is a color palette generator.
It segments _(quantizes)_ the image into a desired amount of key colors.
This can help creating a color palette that closely matches an image.

You can increase/decrease the amount of colors by scrolling up/down or using the slider (the size is currently restricted to 3 to 32 colors).
The switch converts the image to grayscale.

Click on a color in the palette to copy its Hex code into the clipboard.
You can also export the simplified version or a screenshot of the color palette to use elsewhere.

You can download a version for Windows, an ELF binary (AppImage), and a pre-release for Android from the https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti/releases[Releases].

<<Development,Read more about each version below.>>

Paletti's website is https://paletti.app.
While I probably mostly use Paletti for myself, I develop it publicly in the hope that it is helpful for other people as well.

Nowadays, I mostly work as a 2D/3D artist on Windows, but I have also been using GNU/Linux in the past, so this is why I like to see Paletti on these two systems. Recently, I started developing an Android version as well.

You are welcome to raise bugs and feature requests here.

== Development

There are currently three distinct versions of Paletti:

1. A version written in Kotlin and JavaFX.
This is targeted to run on Windows.
2. A version written in Vala and GTK.
This gets packaged into an AppImage to be run on GNU/Linux.
3. An Android version (written in Kotlin).

I try to develop each version in tandem, i.e. keeping the same version number, and adding the same features.

**Paletti's current version is 2.0.**

=== Windows

Paletti's Windows version is written in Kotlin with JavaFX.
It is themed to look like a modern UWP application.

The project is built with Gradle.
Running Paletti requires Java, but `jpackage` bundles the necessary JRE, so nothing else is needed to run Paletti.

Being written in JavaFX, this version should theoretically run on GNU/Linux and macOS as well.
However, I haven't tested this and don't intend to work on this.
It is written for Windows; for GNU/Linux, please use the GTK version described below.

=== ELF binary (AppImage)

This version is written in Vala using the Meson build system.
It should fit well into desktop environments using GTK, e.g. GNOME.
Next to Vala and GTK, you need Leptonica which you can probably install using your distribution's package manager, e.g. `leptonica-devel`.
The library is abbreviated as `lept`.

Create a `build` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then run `meson build`.
Inside `build/`, you can then run `ninja`.

The AppImage is generated by a simple Makefile inside `dist/`.

=== Android

The Android version is currently in early development.
You can download a beta version from the https://github.com/Eroica/Paletti/releases[Releases].
