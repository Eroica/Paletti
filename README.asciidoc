= Paletti

**Note:** This is the old JavaFX/Kotlin version of Paletti. A newer version (from 2.0) is written in Vala for GTK, and doesn't use a WebView/color-thief.js/JavaScript anymore.

'''

I basically took https://alembicforsketch.com/[Alembic] and put it into a JavaFX WebView.
Alembic was originally developed by https://www.awkward.co/[Awkward] and licensed under the MIT license.

I added a small feature so that you can scroll up and down to increase/decrease the size of the color palette (between 6 and 12).

Paletti creates a color palette of an image that you drop into it. Click on a tile to put that color into your clipboard.

== Installation

A Windows executable is available under Releases.
I used `jpackage` to build it which bundles the necessary JRE, so nothing else is required to run Paletti.

For other systems or compiling from source, see <<Building>>.

== Building

Paletti is built with Gradle and packaged with `jpackage` into an executable.
You should be at least using JDK 14.
