  0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 1.0 of RecEx Shared
 Source License.

 "The program", "the source", "the source code", "these
 files", "this file" refers to any copyrightable work
 licensed under this License.

 "You" refers to the Licensee. The licensee could be a
 person or a organisation.

 licensee, and not by any other person or organisation
 related in any way to the licensee.

  1. Usage

 You are free to download, copy, compile, study, and
 refer to the source code for any personal use of yours.

 not, directly or indirectly, enable its usage by any
 other individual or organisation.
